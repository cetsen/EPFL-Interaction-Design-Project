# EPFL CS-486 Interaction Design Project -- Punctuality App
Group project for CS-486 Interaction Design master's course at EPFL where we designed a mobile application that helps people improve their punctuality.

PunctuAll™ helps users overcome lateness, avoid the shame that comes with it, and improve their daily productivity. It achieves this by allowing its users to compete with their peers in a “race” to an event, to check their progress in their journey through checkpoints and to compare their lateness against each other through a ranking system based on “punctuality points”.
